## Industrial Machine Fault Detection using Deep Learning

### Machines: Pumps, motors, valves etc. 

1. Industrial equipment such as motors and pumps emit characteristic sounds when running normally
2. In case of system faults, the sound emitted changes
3. We build a deep-learning model to detect abnormal behaviour 
4. The model is a multi-equipment system expected to learn to detect difference between "normal operation" sounds generated by three different types of equipment
5. ... as well as the abnormal sounds
