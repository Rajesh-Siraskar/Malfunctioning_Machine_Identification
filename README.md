## Industrial Machine Fault Detection using Deep Learning

### Machines: Pumps, valves, slide-rails and industrial fans etc. 

1. Industrial equipment such as motors and pumps emit characteristic sounds when running normally
2. In case of system faults, the sound emitted changes
3. We build a deep-learning model to detect abnormal behaviour 
4. The model is a multi-equipment system expected to learn to detect difference between "normal operation" sounds generated by three different types of equipment
5. ... as well as the abnormal sounds
6. Application:

Consider a Cement Plant where the Fan forms an important equipment.

Operational issues
BLOCKAGES AND PERFORMANCE
Build-ups
- increasing build-ups cause reduced gas flows at the same ID fan pressure
Fluctuating gas flows due to fluctuating O2 and heat levels, CO-increases and excess O2 requires ID fan increase

•        Fluctuating fuel
fluctuating temps cause fuel increase, thereby increasing S or Cl inputs

•        Cold Air Ingress
Increasing the ID fan to keep up, kiln inlet under-pressure increase draws in more false air

•        Circulating Phenomena
Destablized operation, CO increase and false air cause volatization to spiral out of control

•        Blockages
increasing volatization causes more build-ups. Return to the start…

INVESTIGATION STEPS
General description of situation (position of build-ups, reproducible conditions that seem to lead to the situation)
Ongoing analysis of hot meal (LOI, SO3, Cl, Na2O, K2O, CaO)
Pyro-section mass and heat balance
Plot ongoing points on Cl-SO3 graph
Sample the build-up material (XRF)
Analyse Inputs-Outputs for responsible circulating element
RESULTS OF BUILD-UPS SEVERE!
Blockages cause unplanned shut-downs and loss of earnings
Constant start-up and stop decreases refractory life
Build-up and dropping off causes mechanical wear of refractory
Severe safety issues involved with cleaning big build-ups
Clinker quality fluctuations + restarts = lots of rejected clinker
Increased heat energy use due to:
dusty clinker reduces radiation inside kiln
more false air and operation at more excess air
Increase shifts to cope with cleaning and higher maintenance
Lower possibility to use alternative fuels because heat levels lower
Clinker cooler instability means increased cement setting times
Lower production level if preheater, kiln inlet, burner, or cooler is the bottleneck
Lower production because away from optimum performance
Increase wear on burner and refractories due to dust and velocities increase
