## Industrial Machine Fault Detection using Deep Learning

### Machines: Pumps, valves, slide-rails and industrial fans etc. 

1. Industrial equipment such as motors and pumps emit characteristic sounds when running normally
2. In case of system faults, the sound emitted changes
3. We build a deep-learning model to detect abnormal behaviour 
4. The model is a multi-equipment system expected to learn to detect difference between "normal operation" sounds generated by three different types of equipment
5. ... as well as the abnormal sounds
6. Application:

Consider a Cement Plant where the Fan forms an important equipment.

### Operational issues

Blockages and Performance:

- Build-ups: Increasing build-ups cause reduced gas flows at the same ID fan pressure
Fluctuating gas flows due to fluctuating O2 and heat levels, CO-increases and excess O2 requires ID fan increase
- Fluctuating fuel: fluctuating temps cause fuel increase, thereby increasing S or Cl inputs
- Cold Air Ingress: Increasing the ID fan to keep up, kiln inlet under-pressure increase draws in more false air
- Circulating Phenomena: destablized operation, CO increase and false air cause volatization to spiral out of control
- Blockages: increasing volatization causes more build-ups.
